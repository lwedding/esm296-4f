  - to answer: why github? can collaborate with edits, even online
  
  - use in current projects ohi-science/issues
    
  -  could apply to your group project / internships / etc.

  - in_memory trick. just so don't clog disk. but doesn't behave well in ArcMap if Add to Display, not there when close and reopen (get red exclamation). Be sure to pull from disk. Get similar effect if output marked as Intermediate in model.
    
  - inputs to models best if on disk, not layers, especially for later scripting
    
  - conceptual. figure for lab1: collapse time (month) & space (country). embed in model.

  - tech setup. RStudio menu Tools > Global Options... not transferring b/n computers so can't find git

- Lab 2
