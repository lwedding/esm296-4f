# Final Project

For the final project, you can:

1. Pick a Species

1. Pick an Ecosystem Service

## Species

If you choose a species, please visit [gbif.org](http://www.gbif.org) to confirm observation data are available and capture a screenshot of the map.  For example, humpback whale (_Megaptera novaeangliae_):

## Ecosystem Service

If you choose ecosystem service, please coordinate with Lisa as to which service and place to use.

## Submit Proposal as project/README.md

Similar to the step of turning in [lab 1 as a markdown report](https://rawgit.com/ucsb-bren/esm296-4f/master/wk1/lab1.html#report-in-markdown), simply write a markdown file to `H:\github\courses\esm296-4f\project\README.md` indicating what you choose to do. Be sure to commit and push this added file.
