# Final Project

For the final project, you can:

1. Pick a Species

1. Pick an Ecosystem Service

## Species

If you choose a species, please visit [gbif.org](http://www.gbif.org) to confirm observation data are available and capture a screenshot of the map.

For capturing a screenshot, I like using the rectangular [Snipping Tool](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-capture-screen-shots#1TC=windows-7) available on Bren SCF/GIS machines. See [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or [rmarkdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/ucsb-bren/esm296-4f/blob/master/wk1/rmarkdown_cheatsheet.pdf?raw=true) for help on including an image in your markdown document.

For example, humpback whale (_Megaptera novaeangliae_):

## Ecosystem Service

If you choose ecosystem service, please coordinate with Lisa as to which service and place to use.

## Submit Proposal as project/README.md

Similar to the step of turning in [lab 1 as a markdown report](https://rawgit.com/ucsb-bren/esm296-4f/master/wk1/lab1.html#report-in-markdown), simply write a markdown file to `H:\esm296-4f\github\project\README.md` (probably need to create project folder) indicating what you choose to do. Be sure to commit and push this added file.
