  abstract = {Bringing together computational research tools in one accessible source, Reproducible Research with R and RStudio guides you in creating dynamic and highly reproducible research. Suitable for researchers in any quantitative empirical discipline, it presents practical tools for data collection, data analysis, and the presentation of results.  With straightforward examples, the book takes you through a reproducible research workflow, showing you how to use:   R for dynamic data gathering and automated results presentation  knitr for combining statistical analysis and results into one document LaTeX for creating PDF articles and slide shows, and Markdown and HTML for presenting results on the web  Cloud storage and versioning services that can store data, code, and presentation files; save previous versions of the files; and make the information widely available  Unix-like shell programs for compiling large projects and converting documents from one markup language to another RStudio to tightly integrate reproducible research tools in one place   Whether you're an advanced user or just getting started with tools such as R and LaTeX, this book saves you time searching for information and helps you successfully carry out computational research. It provides a practical reproducible research workflow that you can use to gather and analyze data as well as dynamically present results in print and on the web. Supplementary files used for the examples and a reproducible research project are available on the author's website.},

@article{roberts_marine_2010,
  abstract = {With the arrival of GPS, satellite remote sensing, and personal computers, the last two decades have witnessed rapid advances in the field of spatially-explicit marine ecological modeling. But with this innovation has come complexity. To keep up, ecologists must master multiple specialized software packages, such as ArcGIS for display and manipulation of geospatial data, R for statistical analysis, and MATLAB for matrix processing. This requires a costly investment of time and energy learning computer programming, a high hurdle for many ecologists. To provide easier access to advanced analytic methods, we developed Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET), an extensible collection of powerful, easy-to-use, open-source geoprocessing tools that ecologists can invoke from ArcGIS without resorting to computer programming. Internally, MGET integrates Python, R, MATLAB, and C++, bringing the power of these specialized platforms to tool developers without requiring developers to orchestrate the interoperability between them.
In this paper, we describe MGET's software architecture and the tools in the collection. Next, we present an example application: a habitat model for Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) that predicts dolphin presence using a statistical model fitted with oceanographic predictor variables. We conclude by discussing the lessons we learned engineering a highly integrated tool framework.},

  abstract = {People around the world are looking to marine ecosystems to provide additional benefits to society. As they consider expanding current uses and investing in new ones, new management approaches are needed that will sustain the delivery of the diverse benefits that people want and need. An ecosystem services framework provides metrics for assessing the quantity, quality, and value of benefits obtained from different portfolios of uses. Such a framework has been developed for assessments on land, and is now being developed for application to marine ecosystems. Here, we present marine Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), a new tool to assess (i.e., map, model, and value) multiple services provided by marine ecosystems. It allows one to estimate changes in a suite of services under different management scenarios and to investigate trade-offs among the scenarios, including implications of drivers like climate. We describe key inputs and outputs of each of the component ecosystem service models and present results from an application to the West Coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The results demonstrate how marine InVEST can be used to help shape the dialogue and inform decision making in a marine spatial planning context. AG and MR led this effort. KA, JB, GG, CK, MM, MP, JT, GV, and SW are the core model development team responsible for building, testing, and applying the models. MB, FC, KC, GG, BG, BH, WL, SL, PL, MM, MP, MP, SP, PR, DS, and HT are our technical working group responsible for intellectual guidance and critical review throughout the project. AD and JS are two practitioners instrumental to the execution of the case study.
