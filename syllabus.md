## Course Description

A series of intensive lab sessions focused on specific computational languages (e.g., Python, R, shell) and tools (e.g., GDAL/OGR, InVEST, MGET, ModelBuilder) applied to the spatial analysis of environmental problems. ESM 263 (or consent of instructor) is an absolute prerequisite.

## Student Learning Outcomes

Students are able to demonstrate a proficiency in the following advanced GIS skills: programming with ArcPy, R, Open-source GIS, Rmarkdown, InVEST, MGET, Online GIS. At the end of the course students will be able to develop spatial questions, design and conduct final group project using one of the advanced GIS skills learned during the lab section of the course.

## Grading

(150 total points)

The **5 lab assignments** (10 points each) are worth **50 points total**. The are due at 08:00 on the Wednesday following the lab in which they were assigned. All homework will be posted to your github and detailed instructions will be reviewed in Week 1 lecture.

The **final group project** is **100 points total** and a Project Proposal is due Friday October 10 at 4 PM. The final report is due Friday, November 7 at 4 PM. Please refer to the **final report rubric** ([PDF](https://purl.org/net/frew/ESM296/final_project_rubric.pdf)) for specific grading details.

## Final Group Project Instructions

For the final group project assignment, you will submit a written report based on analysis with a geospatial tool, introduced in ESM 296-4F, in the following topical areas:

* **Ecosystem service evaluation**
    * Pick an ecosystem service. See InVEST manual: recommend only Coastal Vulnerability model for California counties / area of interest.
    
* **Species distribution modeling**
    * Pick a species, identify observations available through GBIF (map of locations for the chosen spp).
