Originally R was developed by Bell Labs for exploratory data analysis. Now it can be used "soup to nuts" for reproducible science.

<div class='notes'>
Python was developed by Guido Von Rossum, the "benevelont dictator" and fan of Monty Python. All core packages and improvements are blessed by Guido, and conforms to a consistent way of thinking, aka the "pythonic" way (vs Perl / Java / R which have many packages doing similar things). It is said to have "batteries included", hence at its core has what you need.
