## Goal

**Task**. You've been tasked by the United Nations to assess countries with highest possible wind energy production.

**Techniques**. You'll learn to manipulate data in space and time starting with an open scientific data format (netcdf). Along the way, you'll learn how to script in Python using the ArcGIS `arcpy` module for access to all the geospatial analysis functions.

## Data

- **NCEP Reanalysis Wind Data**
  http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/societal-impacts/wind
    - spatial resolution: 2.5 x 2.5 degrees and temporal resolution daily.
    - temporal resolution: daily
    - file format: netcdf (*.nc)

- **Natural Earth | 1:10m Cultural Vectors | Admin 0 â€“ Countries**
  http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-countries/
    - spatial resolution: 1:10m
    - version: 
    - file format: shapefile (*.shp)

## Methods

### Extract Raster Layer from NetCDF


### Calculate Speed from U and V Winds



This dataset is available daily and globally at , and the gridded data is interpolated down to a 0.25 X 0.25 degree resolution to provide finer detail.

The monthly mean wind speed and the monthly wind speed anomaly with respect to the 1971-2000 base period are calculated from the daily average U (east-west) and V (north-south) wind components and plotted for the contiguous United States.
