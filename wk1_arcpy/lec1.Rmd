# Motivation

## Why Git?

Git is the versioning engine.

## Why Python?

<div class='notes'>
Python was developed by Guido Von Rossum, the "benevelont dictator" and fan of Monty Python. All core packages and improvements are blessed by Guido, and conforms to a consistent way of thinking, aka the "pythonic" way (vs Perl / Java / R which have many packages doing similar things). It is said to have "batteries included", hence at its core has what you need.

## Why R? {.flexbox .vcenter}

Originally R was developed by Bell Labs for exploratory data analysis. Now it can be used "soup to nuts" for reproducible science.

# Specifics

## Git / Github Flow

![](img/github_flow.png)

Division of labor:

- git performs these actions
- github stores repositories online

Permissions:

- ucsb-bren/esm296-4f: pull only (no push privileges)
- USER/courses: push and pull

## Git / Github Features

GOOD:

- **text** formats (txt, r, py, md...)
- **backup** to offsite archive, and **rewind** changes
- **document** changes of code and files with issues and messages
- **collaborate** with others and **publish** to web site

BAD:

- **binary** formats (eg docx, pdf, shp...)
- **big** files (limits: 1GB per repository, 100MB per file)


## Folder Structure

So your local file structure will look like this:

H:/

- **github/esm296-4f**: read-only course repo
- **github/courses/esm296-4f**: read-write personal courses repo containing esm296-4f folder
- **esm296-4f/**: personal workspace for working through labs and everything else, especially for big data files
